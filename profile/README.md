[Zerocracy] boosts the productivity of software teams by rewarding and punishing programmers when they deserve it.

First, you get a token at [zerocracy.com][Zerocracy].
Then, you add a new GitHub Actions workflow with the [judges-action] plugin to your GitHub repository.
Finally, you get a report similar to [this one][vitals].
You and all your team members will know who contributes how much.
You will be able to reward them based on this information.
You can also let Zerocracy distribute money among programmers, according to their contribution.
